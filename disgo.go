// Package disgo is a logging and prompting library for
// modern command line interfaces.
//
// It is NOT a substitute for a structured logger
// in an application or a microservice, since it is
// completely centered around user interaction and
// user-friendly terminal interfaces.
//
// The packages that compose disgo can be used independently.
//
// The logger pakage (github.com/Ullaakut/disgo/logger) is a
// simplified logger which only handles two basic log levels
// (standard and debug).
//
// The prompter package (github.com/Ullaakut/disgo/prompter)
// is a simple user prompter that asks users for input data
// or confirmations.
//
// The symbol package (github.com/Ullaakut/disgo/symbol)
// provides access to cherry-picked UTF-8 symbols that are
// useful for making user-friendly command line interfaces.
