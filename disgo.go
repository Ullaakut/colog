// Package disgo is a console output and prompting library for
// modern command line interfaces.
//
// It does not provide structured logging and is not built
// with performance in mind, since it is aimed at building
// user-friendly command line interfaces, and not applications.
//
// The packages that compose disgo can be used independently.
//
// The console package (github.com/Ullaakut/disgo/console) is a
// simplified console output library which only handles two basic
// output levels (standard and debug), and can also manage outputs
// for step-by-step processes as well as formatting outputs.
//
// The prompter package (github.com/Ullaakut/disgo/prompter)
// is a simple user prompter that asks users for input data
// or confirmations.
//
// The symbol package (github.com/Ullaakut/disgo/symbol)
// provides access to cherry-picked UTF-8 symbols that are
// useful for making user-friendly command line interfaces.
